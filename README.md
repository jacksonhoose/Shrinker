# Shrinker

It has been my lifelong work to bring human-resizing technology to the masses and it is finally here.  

Being a fullstack web developer I hear many great ideas of apps to build from friends and family, but one has echoed more than any other over my many weeks in the field, and that is to create software that will shrink its user to 4% of their original size.  I introduce Shrinker.  Equiped with the latest in kebnobeam technology, people can finally experience the joy of being a tiny little person, so tiny you could saddle up a hamster and ride it across the living room.

Some people are quick to use Shrinker, but they must understand that the technology to enlarge them back to their originial size does not yet exist, so please use with caution.
